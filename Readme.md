
- (Hound) => Frontend and backend of app using react native & React Native Async Storage for database
- (Backend & Bend) => working model in an app using Flask & React Native

- (Backend) => smaller model firstly trained to check prescription
- (Bend) => larger model integrated with flask, no frontend currently due to space complexity to run such a larger model

Hope you love it !!!!!!
